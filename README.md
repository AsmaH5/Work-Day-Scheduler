# Work-Day-Scheduler

This Work-Day-Scheduler displays all the skills I have learned so far,  about DOM manipulation, advanced JavaScript, integration of third-party APIs, and more. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I have used the Moment.js Links to an external site. library to work with date and time. 

## Built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery

## Usage:
* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

* Color-coded timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

* Allows users to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

* Allows users to save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page.
